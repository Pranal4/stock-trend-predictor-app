QuantumLeap AI - Institutional Trend ForecasterLive Application URL: https://stock-predictor-api-516063785117.asia-south1.run.appProject OverviewThis project is a comprehensive, end-to-end machine learning application designed to forecast stock market trends. It demonstrates a full MLOps pipeline, from initial data acquisition and feature engineering to model training, containerization, and final deployment as a scalable, interactive web service on Google Cloud Run.The application provides a dual-analysis system:Quantitative Forecast: A trained XGBoost model provides a binary prediction (UP/DOWN) for the stock's trend over the next 5 days based on key technical indicators.Qualitative Insight: An integrated Gemini LLM, grounded with Google Search, provides a real-time, context-aware analysis of the market situation based on the same indicators, offering a human-like "why" behind the model's prediction.This project serves as a portfolio piece showcasing skills in data science, ML engineering, cloud-native deployment, and full-stack development.Core FeaturesInteractive UI: A sophisticated, responsive, dark-themed single-page application built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript serves as the project's dashboard and user interface.Dual-Model System: Combines a predictive XGBoost model for quantitative forecasting with the Gemini LLM for qualitative analysis.Live API Service: The entire backend is served via a FastAPI application, containerized with Docker, and deployed on Google Cloud Run for global scalability.Automated Cloud Builds: Deployed via a modern, cloud-native workflow where the Docker image is built and deployed by Google Cloud Build.Technology StackCategoryTechnologyPurposeProgramming LanguagePython 3.9Core language for backend and model development.Data SciencePandas, NumPy, Scikit-learnData manipulation, feature scaling, and baseline modeling.ML ModelXGBoostAdvanced gradient boosting model for trend prediction.Generative AIGoogle Gemini APIFor generating qualitative, context-aware market analysis.API FrameworkFastAPIHigh-performance web framework for the prediction and analysis API.ContainerizationDockerTo package the application into a portable, reproducible container.Cloud DeploymentGoogle Cloud Run, Cloud Build, Artifact RegistryServerless deployment, automated cloud-native builds, and image storage.FrontendHTML, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScriptFor creating the interactive and responsive user interface.Development ToolsJupyterLab, VS Code, GitFor analysis, coding, and version control.Project WorkflowProblem Definition: Framed the task as a binary classification problem to predict the 5-day trend.EDA & Feature Engineering: Acquired raw data from yfinance, visualized trends, and engineered predictive features (Moving Averages, Volatility, ROC).Baseline Modeling: Trained a Logistic Regression model to establish a baseline performance metric.Advanced Modeling: Trained an XGBoost model and used GridSearchCV to find the optimal hyperparameters.API Development: Built a robust API using FastAPI with Pydantic for data validation.Containerization: Created a Dockerfile to blueprint the application environment.Cloud Deployment: Deployed the containerized application to Google Cloud Run using the gcloud CLI and a cloud-native build process.Frontend Development: Built a sophisticated, single-page web application to serve as the project's interactive dashboard.LLM Integration: Added a new API endpoint to call the Gemini API, enhancing the application with AI-powered qualitative insights.Documentation: Created this README to document the project's architecture, process, and technologies.This project was developed over a weekend as an intensive, end-to-end mentorship exercise.
